# Finding Roots #

Finding roots contains several numberical methods that use iterative approximation to find the roots of functions. 

## RootFinding.c ##
RootFinding.c contains examples of the following methods
* Bisection Method
* Regula-Falsi Method
* Secant Method


## RootFinding2.c ##
RootFinding2.c contains the methods in the RootFinding.c file but adds the assumption that the methods have access to the first derivative of the function being optimized for. This file also adds the newton method, which requires the first derivative.
